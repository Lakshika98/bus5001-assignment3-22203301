# Reflections.md â€“ Critical Analysis Based on Cloud Architectures Material

## 1. Accuracy and Relevance
- Most answers and summaries were grounded in the uploaded content and were factually correct.
- For example, the AI accurately summarised horizontal vs vertical scaling, and explained the concept of hypervisors.
- However, one response on "DevOps lifecycle" included extra details not present in the lecture notes.

## 2. Usefulness in Academic Workflows
- NotebookLM significantly reduced revision time and helped organise key topics from the Cloud Architectures lecture.
- Being able to highlight and question sections of Azure history or scaling models was helpful before assessments.
- The Notebook Cards served as personalised revision notes.

## 3. Limitations or Concerns
- The tool occasionally hallucinated definitions when queries were too vague.
- File formatting (e.g., slides with complex visuals) occasionally limited parsing accuracy.
- Source-based citation links sometimes directed to generic headings without detailed context.

ðŸ“Œ *Overall Recommendation*: Suitable for structured academic study, especially when materials are clearly formatted. Promising tool for guided use by students and lecturersÂ alike.
